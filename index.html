                    <p>Before we explore accounting in depth, it's important to understand that the type of business structure shapes almost every part of the accounting process - from how profits are calculated and taxed, to who has reporting obligations, and even how decisions are made.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>We're going to cover the most common forms of businesses in the UK, and those are;</p>

                    <p>Throughout this website, you'll notice that accounting topics - whether in management, financial, or taxation - are explained with reference to these business types.

                    <h1 id="sole-traders">Sole Traders</h1>
                    <br>
                    <p>In the UK, a sole trader is the simplest and most common business structure, where the business is owned by one person. From a legal view, the business and the individual owning it, are a single entity (they are one in the same). This means that there are; <u>Legal and Accounting</u>, <u>Personal Liability</u>, <u>Financial Reporting Standards</u>, and <u>Taxation</u>, that are implicatied for the business owner personally (again, they are one, not separate).</p>
                    <br>
                    <h2>Legal and Accounting</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>The taxable profits of a sole trader are taxed as personal income for the owner of the business, this is where they will pay Income Tax and National Insurance Contributions – similar to that of an employee. <span class="info-wrapper">
                        <span class="info-button" onclick="toggleInfo('info1')">i</span>
                    </span></p>
                    <div id="info1" class="info-box">Taxable profits are calculated by reviewing the business's incomes and expenses from Revenue down to Accounting Profit (as shown in the Income Statement), focusing only on those amounts that are taxable. It’s this taxable profit that Income Tax and National Insurance Contributions are based on. (Capital Allowances are subtracted from this in substitute for depreciation)</div>
                    <br>
                    <h2>Extent of Personal Liability</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>Due to sole traders and their owners being viewed as one by the law, not only is their income regarded as personal, as are their liabilities; meaning, all liabilities (creditors – suppliers, banks, customers), are the business owner’s responsibility. This opens them up to lawsuits regarding the seizure of personal assets (property, savings, vehicles etc) for repaying back money owed to creditors. <span class="info-wrapper">
                        <span class="info-button" onclick="toggleInfo('info2')">i</span>
                    </span></p>
                    <div id="info2" class="info-box">In other words, sole traders have no legal protection from debts and losses the business incurs, and should that happen, the business owners personal assets are “up for grabs”.</div>
                    <br>
                    <h2>Financial Reporting Standards</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>Sole Traders do not have any responsibilities as far as statutory reporting goes, at least as far as the law is concerned. However, they must document and report to HMRC a list of incomes and expenses generates within the financial year, along with file their taxes in their self-assessment. <span class="info-wrapper">
                        <span class="info-button" onclick="toggleInfo('info3')">i</span>
                    </span></p>
                    <div id="info3" class="info-box">Incomes and Expenses that are documented, must also be kept for a minimum of 5-years from the date of self-assessment deadline. (i.e., for 25/26 (6th April - 5th April), the self-assessment deadline would be 31st January 2027 - so they should be kept until 31st January 2032).</div>
                    <br>
                    <p>Despite their being no legal obligation besides incomes and expenses, it is best practice for Sole Traders to document their finances as any company would.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Doing so would better allow them to plan, budget for and prepare for the period/s ahead. It does not need to be as extensive as companies, but the better they are, the better prepared they will be.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h2>Taxation</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>As we know, sole traders are taxed as individuals, and are subject to Income Tax and National Insurance Contributions, however, another key aspect of taxation for sole traders, would be their pension contributions too. Before we get to the rates of Income Tax, NI Contributions and Pensions – let's first explain how a pension would work for a sole trader.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Pensions contributions are broken down into two main categories, Public and Private. A public pension would be tailored for those more situated within a civil servant role, for example, NHS, Government, Police, Ambulance Service, Fire Service etc. A sole trader would not find themselves to be within this category, however, this is still relevant in the case where the owner of a sole trader was previously within such roles. A private pension would be tailored for those more situated within a role that does not full under the purview of a civil servant, someone like a business owner.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>If the owner of a sole trader has a public pension, contributions to such pot would be prevented – in other words, the account would be frozen preventing contributions to it. However, it will still rise due to inflation, and it will still become available upon retirement age. With the move from a civil servant position to being a business owner, the owner would opt for a private pension, where they can contribute to that. Upon hitting retirement age, the business owner would begin to receive both public and private contributions that they made as income.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Because the sole trader’s income is taxed as personal income, the question arises to whether taxable income is reduced by the contributions, and how HMRC view it. To simplify things, at the end of the financial year, the pension provider will notify the contributor with a summary, detailing their gross pension contributions (the amount in which they contributed, and tax-relief secured), this, along with taxable profits of the sole trader will be submitted to HMRC on/by the 31st January through a Self-Assessment. This is due the following year to the financial year the self-assessment pertains to.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>As for contributions to the pension pot, there are limitation to the amount contributed, and implications in going over them. You can find this below, along with rates etc.</p>

                    <p>When a business decides to launch a product/service, there are costs that are incurred as part of the production process, or delivering a service. It is during this phase that Accountants need to absorbe fixed overheads, or in other words, the costs of the business as a whole that are nothing to do with the production or delivery of service. These are things like rent, gas and electricity, salaries for Accountants, lawyer fees etc.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>These costs need to be absored into each unit sold/service provided. This process helps businesses cover the costs of running the business for each and every unit sold/service provided. There are two main ways in which businesses do this;</p>
