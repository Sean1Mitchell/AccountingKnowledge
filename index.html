We'll be using the legal structures of business to curate how we deliver management, financial, and taxation, so understanding these are important as we progress.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p>Before we explore accounting in depth, it's important to understand that the type of business structure shapes almost every part of the accounting process - from how profits are calculated and taxed, to who has reporting obligations, and even how decisions are made.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>We're going to cover the most common forms of businesses in the UK, and those are;</p>

                    <p><b>Note:</b> Partnerships are comprised of Ordinary, Limited, and Limited Liability.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>These aren't just legal labels - they define the responsibilities of owners, the extent of liability, the tax rules applied, and the kind of financial statements prepared.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Throughout this website, you'll notice that accounting topics - whether in management, financial, or taxation - are explained with reference to these business types. This gives each concept a practical footing and prepares you to apply your knowledge in the real world, whether you're sitting an exam, or advising a client.</p>

                    <h1 id="sole-traders">Sole Traders</h1>
                    <br>
                    <p>In the UK, a sole trader is the simplest and most common business structure, where the business is owned by one person. From a legal view, the business and the individual owning it, are a single entity (they are one in the same). This means that there are; <u>Legal and Accounting</u>, <u>Personal Liability</u>, <u>Financial Reporting Standards</u>, and <u>Taxation</u>, that are implicatied for the business owner personally (again, they are one, not separate).</p>
                    <br>
                    <h2>Legal and Accounting</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>The taxable profits of a sole trader are taxed as personal income for the owner of the business, this is where they will pay Income Tax and National Insurance Contributions – similar to that of an employee. <span class="info-wrapper">
                        <span class="info-button" onclick="toggleInfo('info1')">i</span>
                    </span></p>
                    <div id="info1" class="info-box">Taxable profits are calculated by reviewing the business's incomes and expenses from Revenue down to Accounting Profit (as shown in the Income Statement), focusing only on those amounts that are taxable. It’s this taxable profit that Income Tax and National Insurance Contributions are based on. (Capital Allowances are subtracted from this in substitute for depreciation)</div>
                    <br>
                    <h2>Extent of Personal Liability</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>Due to sole traders and their owners being viewed as one by the law, not only is their income regarded as personal, as are their liabilities; meaning, all liabilities (creditors – suppliers, banks, customers), are the business owner’s responsibility. This opens them up to lawsuits regarding the seizure of personal assets (property, savings, vehicles etc) for repaying back money owed to creditors. <span class="info-wrapper">
                        <span class="info-button" onclick="toggleInfo('info2')">i</span>
                    </span></p>
                    <div id="info2" class="info-box">In other words, sole traders have no legal protection from debts and losses the business incurs, and should that happen, the business owners personal assets are “up for grabs”.</div>
                    <br>
                    <h2>Financial Reporting Standards</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>Sole Traders do not have any responsibilities as far as statutory reporting goes, at least as far as the law is concerned. However, they must document and report to HMRC a list of incomes and expenses generates within the financial year, along with file their taxes in their self-assessment. <span class="info-wrapper">
                        <span class="info-button" onclick="toggleInfo('info3')">i</span>
                    </span></p>
                    <div id="info3" class="info-box">Incomes and Expenses that are documented, must also be kept for a minimum of 5-years from the date of self-assessment deadline. (i.e., for 25/26 (6th April - 5th April), the self-assessment deadline would be 31st January 2027 - so they should be kept until 31st January 2032).</div>
                    <br>
                    <p>Despite their being no legal obligation besides incomes and expenses, it is best practice for Sole Traders to document their finances as any company would.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Doing so would better allow them to plan, budget for and prepare for the period/s ahead. It does not need to be as extensive as companies, but the better they are, the better prepared they will be.</p>
