                    <p>Before we explore accounting in depth, it's important to understand that the type of business structure shapes almost every part of the accounting process - from how profits are calculated and taxed, to who has reporting obligations, and even how decisions are made.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>We're going to cover the most common forms of businesses in the UK, and those are;</p>

                    <p><b>Note:</b> Partnerships are comprised of Ordinary, Limited, and Limited Liability.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>These aren't just legal labels - they define the responsibilities of owners, the extent of liability, the tax rules applied, and the kind of financial statements prepared.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Throughout this website, you'll notice that accounting topics - whether in management, financial, or taxation - are explained with reference to these business types. This gives each concept a practical footing and prepares you to apply your knowledge in the real world, whether you're sitting an exam, or advising a client.</p>

                    <h1 id="sole-traders">Sole Traders</h1>
                    <br>
                    <p>In the UK, a sole trader is the simplest and most common business structure, where the business is owned by one person. From a legal view, the business and the individual owning it, are a single entity (they are one in the same). This means that there are; <u>Legal and Accounting</u>, <u>Personal Liability</u>, <u>Financial Reporting Standards</u>, and <u>Taxation</u>, that are implicatied for the business owner personally (again, they are one, not separate).</p>
                    <br>
                    <h2>Legal and Accounting</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>The taxable profits of a sole trader are taxed as personal income for the owner of the business, this is where they will pay Income Tax and National Insurance Contributions – similar to that of an employee. <span class="info-wrapper">
                        <span class="info-button" onclick="toggleInfo('info1')">i</span>
                    </span></p>
                    <div id="info1" class="info-box">Taxable profits are calculated by reviewing the business's incomes and expenses from Revenue down to Accounting Profit (as shown in the Income Statement), focusing only on those amounts that are taxable. It’s this taxable profit that Income Tax and National Insurance Contributions are based on. (Capital Allowances are subtracted from this in substitute for depreciation)</div>
                    <br>
                    <h2>Extent of Personal Liability</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>Due to sole traders and their owners being viewed as one by the law, not only is their income regarded as personal, as are their liabilities; meaning, all liabilities (creditors – suppliers, banks, customers), are the business owner’s responsibility. This opens them up to lawsuits regarding the seizure of personal assets (property, savings, vehicles etc) for repaying back money owed to creditors. <span class="info-wrapper">
                        <span class="info-button" onclick="toggleInfo('info2')">i</span>
                    </span></p>
                    <div id="info2" class="info-box">In other words, sole traders have no legal protection from debts and losses the business incurs, and should that happen, the business owners personal assets are “up for grabs”.</div>
                    <br>
                    <h2>Financial Reporting Standards</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>Sole Traders do not have any responsibilities as far as statutory reporting goes, at least as far as the law is concerned. However, they must document and report to HMRC a list of incomes and expenses generates within the financial year, along with file their taxes in their self-assessment. <span class="info-wrapper">
                        <span class="info-button" onclick="toggleInfo('info3')">i</span>
                    </span></p>
                    <div id="info3" class="info-box">Incomes and Expenses that are documented, must also be kept for a minimum of 5-years from the date of self-assessment deadline. (i.e., for 25/26 (6th April - 5th April), the self-assessment deadline would be 31st January 2027 - so they should be kept until 31st January 2032).</div>
                    <br>
                    <p>Despite their being no legal obligation besides incomes and expenses, it is best practice for Sole Traders to document their finances as any company would.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Doing so would better allow them to plan, budget for and prepare for the period/s ahead. It does not need to be as extensive as companies, but the better they are, the better prepared they will be.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h2>Taxation</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>As we know, sole traders are taxed as individuals, and are subject to Income Tax and National Insurance Contributions, however, another key aspect of taxation for sole traders, would be their pension contributions too. Before we get to the rates of Income Tax, NI Contributions and Pensions – let's first explain how a pension would work for a sole trader.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Pensions contributions are broken down into two main categories, Public and Private. A public pension would be tailored for those more situated within a civil servant role, for example, NHS, Government, Police, Ambulance Service, Fire Service etc. A sole trader would not find themselves to be within this category, however, this is still relevant in the case where the owner of a sole trader was previously within such roles. A private pension would be tailored for those more situated within a role that does not full under the purview of a civil servant, someone like a business owner.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>If the owner of a sole trader has a public pension, contributions to such pot would be prevented – in other words, the account would be frozen preventing contributions to it. However, it will still rise due to inflation, and it will still become available upon retirement age. With the move from a civil servant position to being a business owner, the owner would opt for a private pension, where they can contribute to that. Upon hitting retirement age, the business owner would begin to receive both public and private contributions that they made as income.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Because the sole trader’s income is taxed as personal income, the question arises to whether taxable income is reduced by the contributions, and how HMRC view it. To simplify things, at the end of the financial year, the pension provider will notify the contributor with a summary, detailing their gross pension contributions (the amount in which they contributed, and tax-relief secured), this, along with taxable profits of the sole trader will be submitted to HMRC on/by the 31st January through a Self-Assessment. This is due the following year to the financial year the self-assessment pertains to.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>As for contributions to the pension pot, there are limitation to the amount contributed, and implications in going over them. You can find this below, along with rates etc.</p>

                    <p>When a business decides to launch a product/service, there are costs that are incurred as part of the production process, or delivering a service. It is during this phase that Accountants need to absorbe fixed overheads, or in other words, the costs of the business as a whole that are nothing to do with the production or delivery of service. These are things like rent, gas and electricity, salaries for Accountants, lawyer fees etc.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>These costs need to be absored into each unit sold/service provided. This process helps businesses cover the costs of running the business for each and every unit sold/service provided. There are two main ways in which businesses do this;</p>

                    <br>
                    <p>Companies Act legislation goes deep into the duties and responsibilities of auditors, where the auditor must express an opinion based on finalised financial statements of companies, and they cover the following:</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><u><b>Auditor's Report on Annual Accounts</b></u></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Auditors must prepare a report for the shareholders of the company, based on the annual accounts of that company. The auditor must also give their opinion as to whether the accounts give a fair and true view of the company's financial position and performance. Whether they have been prepared in accordance with Companies Act 2006, and whether they comply with the relevant financial reporting frameworks.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><u><b>Auditor's Report on Director's Report</b></u></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Auditors must express an opinion on whether the information given in the directors’ report is consistent with the financial statements. Ensuring that the directors’ report does not contradict the audited financial statements.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><u><b>Auditor’s Report on Strategic Report and Directors’ Report</b></u></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Auditors must state whether the strategic report and directors’ report are consistent with the financial statements. Ensuring both reports align with the audited financial data, providing shareholders with reliable information.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><u><b>Duties of Auditors</b></u></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The duties of an auditor are to examine accounting records to ensure proper account records have been kept. Ensure consistency within the account and account records. Report if they have not received all necessary information for the audit. Ensure proper returns are received from branches not visited. If any of these are not met, the auditor must state this in their report.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><u><b>Auditors’ Right to Information</b></u></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Auditors have the right to access all books, account, and information required for the audit. Directors and officers must provide the requested information and explanations promptly. This ensures the auditor can fully investigate the company’s financial affairs without obstruction.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><u><b>Auditor’s Rights to Attend Company Meetings</b></u></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Auditors have the right to attend any general meetings, receive all notices and communications related to these meetings, and have the ability to speak on matters related to the audit and the financial statements. This ensures auditors can clarify and defend their findings directly to shareholders.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><u><b>Statement in Case of Auditor’s Removal</b></u></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>If an auditor is removed before their term ends, they can submit a statement explaining the reasons. The company must send this statement to all shareholders and notify them of its availability. This ensures transparency and allows auditors to express concerns about potential management interference.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><u><b>Auditor’s Rights in Relation to Written Resolutions</b></u></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>If shareholders propose a written resolution that affects auditors (e.g., removal), auditors must receive a copy of the resolution and have the right to respond in writing. The company must circulate the auditor’s response to shareholders. This prevents unfair removal or decisions without giving auditors a change to explain their side.</p>

                    <h2>Independence of Auditors</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p><u><b>Auditor Independence</b></u></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Auditors must remain independent and unbiased in their examination of a companies financial statement, and the Companies Act 2006 legislation enforces that this remains the case.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><u><b>Appointment of Auditors of Private Companies</b></u></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Private companies must appoint an auditor for each financial year unless they are exempt (e.g., small companies under audit exemption thresholds). The appointment must occur within 29-days of the companies financial year-end (if not already done at a general meeting). If a company fails to appoint an auditor, the directors have the authority to do so. This ensures private companies cannot indefinitely avoid audits, maintaining transparency and accountability.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><u><b>Appointment of Auditors of Public Companies</b></u></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Public companies must appoint auditors at each annual general meeting (AGM) to serve until the next AGM. Appointment also requires a majority vote by shareholders. This reinforces auditor independence by ensuring they are appointed directly by shareholders rather than management.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><u><b>Term of Office for Auditors</b></u></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Auditors hold office from the end of the meeting, at which they are appointed, until the conclusion of the next AGM (for public companies) or until an auditor is reappointed or replaced. This establishes a clear and consistent term for auditors, preventing indefinite appointments that could compromise independence.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><u><b>Reappointment of Auditors</b></u></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Auditors are automatically reappointed for the next financial year, however, unless a resolution has been passed to appoint someone else or not to reappoint them, they have declined reappointment, or the company is exempt from requiring an audit. This simplifies the reappointment process while allowing shareholders to intervene if necessary.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><u><b>Prevention of Automatic Reappointment</b></u></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Automatic reappointment is prevented if the auditor was appointed by the directors rather than by a resolution at a general meeting, a member of the company has notified the company of an objection to reappointment, or the auditor’s term has expired due to specific disqualification reasons (e.g., independence concerns). This safeguards against potential conflicts of interest by ensuring reappointment cannot occur automatically under certain circumstances.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><u><b>Resolution to Remove Auditors</b></u></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Shareholders may pass an ordinary resolution at any time to remove the auditor, regardless of their term in office. The auditor must be given notice and the opportunity to make written representations that must be sent to shareholders. This ensures that auditors can only be removed transparently and fairly, protecting their independence by allowing them to explain the circumstances to shareholders.</p>

                    <br>
                    <h2>The Audit Year</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p><u><b>Interim</b></u></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The interim typically occurs partway through the financial year, usually six months before the final audit. The auditor elected by the board of directors at the annual general meeting will review internal controls, perform analytical procedures, and test transactions from start of the year until the period they are at. The purpose of this is to identify risks early while reducing the pressure at year-end, and to improve the efficiency of the final audit.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><u><b>Stock-Take/Inventory Check</b></u></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>At the end of the financial year, a physical inventory count is done, however, sometimes this is done at interim points too. If an external audit is required, auditors may observe the stock-take to ensure that it’s carried out correctly and that the valuation method aligns with relevant accounting standards. Companies that use perpetual inventory systems may choose to still perform periodic checks to ensure accuracy.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><u><b>Final Audit</b></u></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The final audit takes place after the financial year ends and when the full financial statements are prepared. This process involves verifying transactions, assessing year-end adjustments – like accruals and prepayments, and confirming the asset valuations. The auditors duty is to prepare a report based on their opinion, typically in the form of an audit report, stating whether they believe the financial statements give a “true and fair view”.</p>

                    <h2>Auditing Staff</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p><u><b>Partner</b></u></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The most senior member of the audit team is the ‘Partner’, and is responsible for signing off the audit report. This ensures that the audit complies with UK auditing standards (ISA UK) and regulatory requirements. They also review key audit findings and communicate with the client’s board of directors or audit committee.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><u><b>Directors</b></u></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Firms that are large tend to have directors who handle complex audits, review key judgements, and act as a final reviewer for other auditors before they sign the work off to the partner. Unlike partners, directors may not have any ownership in the firm.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><u><b>Managers</b></u></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The next on the list is the ‘Managers, and is responsible for overseeing the audit process and ensures deadlines, and quality standards are met. They act as the main point of contact between the audit firm and the client’s senior management team. Additionally, they review work done by supervisors and trainees before it goes to the partner. They ensure to allocate tasks within the audit team to make sure resources are used effectively.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><u><b>Supervisors</b></u></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Audit supervisors act as a bridge between trainees and managers in the hierarchy of auditing staff. They typically assist in the planning of audits, reviewing work completed by trainee auditors, and resolve potential technical issues.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><u><b>Trainee (or equvialent terms)</b></u></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Trainees are entry-level auditors completing their professional qualification. They typically carry out basic audit procedures like checking financial records, testing controls, and documenting findings. They are usually trained/given guidance until they have passed their professional qualification by their supervisors.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><u><b>Others</b></u></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Other audit staff members include forensic accountants who investigate fraud and litigation support, or technical specialists who provide areas in, for example, IFRS, tax, or data analytics. And we have IT auditors, who are more focused on technology and cyber risks in financial reporting.</p>

                    <h2>Use of Organisational Charts for Knowledge of Business and it's staff</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>Organisation charts are visual representations of a company’s structure, showing hierarchical relationships, reporting lines, and key personnel. In auditing, these charts help auditors gain an understanding of the business and its staff, which is crucial for assessing risk, internal controls, and fraud detection.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><b>Understanding the Business Structure</b></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>By having charts, auditors are better able to:</p>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Identify Key Decision-Makers</b> - who holds authority in financial reporting and operations?</li>
                        <li><b>Recognise Reporting Lines</b> - how responsibilities flow within the organisation.</li>
                        <li><b>Assess Decentralisation vs. Centralisation</b> - is financial control spread out or centralised?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <p>for example, in a multinational company, an organisation chart can reveal whether financial oversight is managed centrally or delegated to regional offices.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><b>Assessing Internal Control Responsibilities</b></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Organisational charts help in evaluating the effectiveness of internal controls by:</p>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Identify Key Control Roles</b> - who is responsible for authorising transactions and approving financial statements?</li>
                        <li><b>Spotting Segregation of Duties Issues</b> - are conflicting roles assigned to the same person, or with someone of relation (family)?</li>
                        <li><b>Assessing Risk of Management Override</b> - if all financial control is concentrated in a few hands, the risk of fraud increases.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <p>for example, the Head of Finance also oversees internal audits, this could be a red flag for independence issues.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><b>Fraud Risk Assessment and Related Parties</b></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Organisational charts help auditors:</p>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Detect Conflicts of Interest</b> - are there undisclosed relationships between key personnel?</li>
                        <li><b>Identify Related Parties</b> - are key individuals in positions to influence transactions with related entities?</li>
                        <li><b>Assess Management's Influence</b> - if one person has excessive control, they could manipulate financial reporting.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <p>for example, if a company's CEO and procurement manager are related, the auditor may need to investigate potential self-dealing or procurement fraud.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><b>Planning the Audit and communication</b></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Auditor's use Organisational Charts to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Determine Who to Interview</b> - identify key personnel for inquiries on controls and financial reporting.</li>
                        <li><b>Plan Audit Procedures</b> - understand which departments handles key financial processes.</li>
                        <li><b>Coordinate with Internal Audit & Compliance</b> - ensure alignment with the company's internal risk management.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <p>for instance, if payroll errors are identified, the auditor can quickly pinpoint which department and personnel oversee payroll processing.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><b>In Conclusion</b></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Organisational charts are essential in audit planning and risk assessment. They provide insights into:</p>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The structure and key personnel of a business</li>
                        <li>The effectiveness of internal controls and segregation of duties.</li>
                        <li>The potential for fraud, conflicts of interest, and management override.</li>

                    <br>
                    <p><u><b>Inherit Risk</b></u></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>This is the risk of a material misstatement ocurring in the financial statements due to the nature of the business or its transactions, before considering internal controls.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Factors affecting Inherit Risk:</p>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Quality of Internal Controls</b> - for example, high-tech companies with complex revenue recognition.</li>
                        <li><b>Complex Transactions</b> - for example, derivatives, mergers, or acquisitions.</li>
                        <li><b>High Level of Estimation and Judgement</b> - for example, asset valuations, provisions.</li>
                        <li><b>Rapid Business Growth or Significant Changes in Operations.</b></li>
                        <li><b>Past Fraud or History of Errors in Financial Statements.</b></li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <p>Auditors assess inherit risk at both the financial statements level (risk of fraud) and the accounts (risk of accounts like revenue or inventory).</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><u><b>Control Risk</b></u></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>This is the risk that a material misstatement will not be prevented, detected, or corrected by the client's internal controls.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Factors affecting Control Risk:</p>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Quality of Internal Controls</b> - for example, segragation of duties, IT controls.</li>
                        <li><b>Management's Attitude towards Internal Controls and Fraud Prevention.</b></li>
                        <li><b>Complexity of the Organisation's Financial Reporting Processes.</b></li>
                        <li><b>Weakness in Prior Internal or External Audits.</b></li>

                    <br>
                    <p><u><b>Detection Risk</b></u></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>This is the risk that auditor's procedures do not detect a material misstatement that exists in the financial statements.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Factors affecting Detection Risk:</p>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>It is influenced by the nature, timing, and extent of audit procedures.</li>
                        <li>It is inversely related to substantive testing - if inheret and control risks are high, auditors reduce detection risk by increasing the extent of testing.</li>
                        <li>It can arise due to human error, poor audit planning, sampling limitations, or the complexity of financial statements.</li>
                        <li>Auditors manage detection risk by improving audit procedures, using professional scepticism, and applying technology and data analytics where appropriate.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Audit and Assurance Council's Definition of Materiality</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>The definition is: “Misstatements, including omissions, are considered to be material if they, individually or in aggregate, could reasonably to be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements.”.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The Key Aspect of Maturity are:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>User-Oriented:</b> where materiality is assessed based on the potential impact on the user of financial statements (investors, creditors, regulators).</li>
                        <li><b>Quantitative and Qualitative Factors:</b> where quantitative is often a percentage of benchmarks such as profit before tax, revenue, total assets, or equity. And where qualitative is even small misstatements where they can be material if they affect compliance with laws, debt covenants, or management integrity.</li>
                        <li><b>Context-Specific:</b> where materiality depends on the nature and circumstances of the business and financial statements.</li>
                        <li><b>Applied Throughout the Audiy:</b> where auditors determine materiality at the planning stage and reassess it as the audit progresses.</li>

                    <p>For auditing, there are IT systems built for auditing, and these are referred to as General and Application Controls. They help in ensuring the reliability and accuracy of financial reporting and compliance with regulations. They are as follows:</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><u><b>General Controls</b></u></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>These are broad, overarching controls that apply to the IT environment as a whole. They help ensure the reliability, security, and integrity of systems used in financial reporting. For example:</p>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Access Control</b> - restricting access to authorised users only.</li>
                        <li><b>Change Management Controls</b> - ensures proper authorisation and testing before the system changes or updates.</li>
                        <li><b>Backups and Recovery Procedures</b> - regular backups, disaster recover planning, and testing.</li>
                        <li><b>IT Security Policies</b> - establishing policies on data protection, cybersecurity, and IT governance.</li>
                        <li><b>Software Development Controls</b> - ensures new systems or updates are tested before implementation.</li>
                        <li><b>Physical Security Controls</b> - restricting access to data centres or servers.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <p>These controls reduce the risl of unauthorised access, system failuresm or data corruption that could impact financial reporting.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><u><b>Application Controls</b></u></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>These are controls specific to individual software applications used in financial processing (accounting software, payroll systems, ERP systems). They help ensure accuracy, completeness, and validity of data within applications. For example:</p>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Input Controls</b> - validations to prevent incorrect data entry (required fields, format checks).</li>
                        <li><b>Processing Controls</b> - ensuring correct processing of transactions (reconciliation, system calculations).</li>
                        <li><b>Output Controls</b> - ensuring reports and financial statements are accurate and complete.</li>
                        <li><b>Integrity Checks</b> - vertification of data accuracy across different systems (audit trails, cross-checking balances).</li>
                        <li><b>Authorisation Controls</b> - ensuring only authorised personnel can approve transactions (manager approvals for payment).</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <p>These controls focus on data accuracy and validity within a specific system rather then the IT environment as a whole.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p>Internal controls ensure that when a business undertakes a transaction such as a sale, the final recording of the transaction on the accounts system reflects the true substance of the transactions. All this means is that internal controls help prevent fraud and errors which would make the accounting information incorrect.</p>

                    <h2>Internal Control Systems</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p><b><u>Control Activities</u></b></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>This includes all procedures designed to ensure management directives are carried out:</p>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Approval and Control of Documents:</b> documents should be approved by an appropriate person. For example, wages, calculations and payments should be approved by senior management.</li>
                        <li><b>Control over IT</b> - passwords, usernames, backups and any other appropriate controls should be in place.</li>
                        <li><b>Reconciliations</b> - key account balances such as bank and debtors should be reconciled on a regular basis.</li>
                        <li><b>Arithmetical Accuracy</b> - items such as invoices should be checked to ensure they are arthmetically correct.</li>
                        <li><b>Control Accounts</b> - control accounts for accounts such as wages, PAYE, VAT should be maintained.</li>
                        <li><b>Restricted Access to Physical Assets</b> - only authorised staff should have access to certain areas of the business such as valuable or sensitive assets.</li>
                        <li><b>Compare Physical counts with accounting records</b> - items such as cash and inventory should be counted periodically and compare to the amount in the accounting records.</li>
                        <li><b>Segregation of Duties</b> - responsibilities should be divided to reduce the risk of fraud and error by employees.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <p><u><b>Risk Assessment</b></u></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The auditor should understand how management assesses risk and how they take action to mitigate risks discovered. And, management shoud be undertaking regular risk assessments to ensure that all risks are identified and mitigated.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><u><b>Infotmation Systems</b></u></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The auditor must obtain an understanding of the information system, including the related business processes, relevant to financial reporting. And, the auditor must decide what areas of the information system are relevant to the financial reporting of the entity and only concentrate on those systems.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><b><u>Monitoring of Controls</u></b></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Controls may be monitored either by management or by the internal audit function if one exists. The auditor may be able to rely on some of the work of internal audit as well, but must first gain an understanding on how controls are monitored and how effective the monitoring is.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><b><u>Strong Control Environment</u></b></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The control environment refers to the framework around which the controls of the organisation operate. Managements attitude will largely determine the nature of the control environment.</p>

                    <p><b><u>Evaluating Internal Controls</u></b></p>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The auditor needs to assess if the system is implemented correctly and is effective.</li>
                        <li>So now the is documented it is time to see if: the controls are implemented and that the controls are effective, and to do this we use tests of controls.</li>
                        <li>Tests of controls will be performed to test the effectiveness. The test concerns: how controls were applied, the consistency of the application, and who applied them.</li>
                        <li>Typical tests include: walkthrough tests (follow a transaction through the system), observation (observe the stock count), computer aided auit techniques.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Limitations on Internal Controls</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p><b><u>Tests of Controls</u></b></p>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Enquiry</b> - ask employees how they carry out certain transactions. Seek management's views by asking them if they feel the system of internal control is operating effectively. Ask whether at some point in the year, such as when people were on holidays or there were staff shortages, the system of internal control was known to have broken down. Ask management how internal control could be improved. You might be able to find some evidence of management's views by looking into board minutes or the minutes of departmental meetings (used in combination with other procedures).</li>
                        <li><b>Inspection</b> - look at evidence of internal control procedures. For example, inspect the file of paid supplier invoices to see if they have indded been stamped or initiated to indicate that they have been paid.</li>
                        <li><b>Observation</b> - watch employees as they carry out certain transactions and procedures. Of course, employees would be on their best behaviour if they knew they were being observed.</li>
                        <li><b>Reperformance</b> - for example, reperform what the employees have done to make sure that they have done it correctly.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <p><b><u>Computer System Controls</u></b></p>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Application Controls and General Controls.</li>
                        <li>Good IT system should have both applications and general IT controls.</li>
                        <li>The auditor must be aware of the implications of the IT systems of the entity.</li>
                        <li>Many transactions may now be automated and the automation must be checked and understood.</li>
                        <li>Large volumes of transactions can now be performed by IT systems leading to greater focus on how the transactions are generated.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <p><b><u>Application Controls</u></b></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Application controls apply to the processing of transactions, examples are:</p>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Batch Total Checks.</li>
                        <li>Sequence Checks.</li>
                        <li>Arithmetic Checks.</li>
                        <li>Existence Checks.</li>

                    <p><b><u>General Controls</u></b></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>General IT controls ensure the information system can run properly, examples include:</p>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Software System Acquisition Controls.</li>

                        <li><b>Transactions and Events:</b> <i>in general, this refers to income statement figures, but will include events such as the purchase of non-current assets.</i></li>
                        <li><b>Account Balances at the Year End:</b> <i>these will be the items on the statement of financial position.</i></li>
                        <li><b>Presentation and Disclosure:</b> <i>this is how the financial statements are presented and how items have been disclosed.</i></li>

                        <li><b>Observation</b> - <i>this means watching others perform a procedure.</i></li>
                        <li><b>Enquiry</b> - <i>this means getting information from people inside and outside of the organisation.</i></li>
                        <li><b>Confirmation</b> - <i>corroborating evidence with third parties.</i></li>
                        <li><b>Reperformance</b> - <i>Recalculating figures or recounting stock.</i></li>

                    <p><b><u>Audit Evidence</u></b></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Auditors need sufficient appropriate evidece, sufficient being the quantity of the audit evidence needed, and appropriate being quality, relevance and reliability of the audit evidence.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><b><u>What is Sufficient and Appropriate?</u></b></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>It reflects appropriately to the level of risk in that specific area. Evidence that is generated from external sources is more reliable than evidence gathered from internal records. Written evidence is much more reliable than oral evidence. Audit-generated evidence is much more reliable than evidence obtained indirectly. Where the audit firm concludes that tests of control can be relied upon, evidence from the client's records is a reliable source of evidence.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The key is to remeber:</p>
                    <br>

                    <p><b><u>Sampling and Materiality</u></b></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>As the auditor can't test everything, only samples are used for substantive testing. Levels of sampling depends on audit risk. Performance materiality used to assist sampling and to assess errors. Typically, we want to cover things like; Non-Current Assets, Inventory, Trade Receivables, Cash and Equivalents, Trade payables, loans, share capital, and then look at both sales and purchases.</p>
                    <br>

                    <p><b><u>Compliance with Relevant Legislation</u></b></p>

                    <br>
                    <p><b><u>The Concept of Going Concern</u></b></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>An entity prepares financial statements on a going concern basis when, under the going concern assumption, the entity is viewed as continuing in business for the foreseeable future. The term foreseeable future is not defined but IAS 1/FRS102 deem the foreseeable future to be a period of at least 12 months from the end of the reporting period.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The concept of going concern is an underlying assumption in the preparation of the financial statements, hence it is assumed that the entity has neither the intention, nor the need, to liquidate or curtail materially the scale of its operations.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>If management conclude that the entity has no alternative but to liquidate or curtail materially the scale of its operations, the going concern basis cannot be used and the financial statements must be prepared on a different basis.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><b><u>Indicators of Going Concern Problems</u></b></p>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Growth in the level of competition faced by the company.</li>
                        <li>Significant decline in demand for its products.</li>
                        <li>Failing to re-invest in new product development.</li>
                        <li>Loss of key staff/inability to recruit suitably experienced staff.</li>
                        <li>Inability or agree suitable financing terms with the bank.</li>
                        <li>Investment in long term assets with short term finance.</li>
                        <li>Delayed payments to suppliers.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <p>The auditors' responsibility for going concern when planning and performing audit procedures, and in evaluating the results thereof, the auditor should consider the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern assumption.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><b><u>In Conclusions</u></b></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The fundamental principle is: when planning and performing the audit procedures and in evaluating the results, the auditor should consider the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern assumption in the preparation of the FS.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Management is required to make an assessment of the enterprise's ability to continue for the foreseeable future considering the following factors:</p>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Financial:</b> <i>BS position, Budgeted negative cash flows, and maturing debts without realistic prospect of repayment.</i></li>
                        <li><b>Operating:</b> <i>Los of key managemenr without replacement, and loss of major market.</i></li>
                        <li><b>Other:</b> <i>Non-compliance with capital or other statutory requirements.</i></li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <p>Auditors must review management's going concern assessment, gather sufficient appropriate evidence to confirm/dispel whether a material uncertainty exists and seek management representations regarding future plans. In carrying out evaluation, procedures should include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Analysing and discussing latest and budgeted financial information.</li>
                        <li>Reading board minutes for reference to financial difficulties and future plans.</li>
                        <li>Review loan agreement terms and determining whether there has been or will likely be any breach.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <p><b><u>Management representation</u></b></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>This standard was recently revised due, mainly, to concerns that auditors may be over-reliant on written representations. While written representations provide necessary audit evidence, they support other forms of evidence and do not on their own provide sufficient appropriate audit evidence.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The auditor must, however, obtain the following written representations about management's responsibilities:</p>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>That they have fulfilled their responsibilities for the preparation of financial statements.</li>
                        <li>That they have provided the auditor with all relevant information and access to records, as agrred in the engagement terms; and</li>
                        <li>That all transactions have been recorded and reflected in the financial statements.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <p><b><u>The Auditor's Report</u></b></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The objective of an auditor, in accordance with ISA 700 forming an opinion and reporting on financial statements are:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>to form an opinion on the financial statements based upon an evaluation of their conclusions drawn from audit evidence; and</li>
                        <li>to express clearly that opinion through a written report.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <p><b>Audition Opinion</b></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>An unqualified opinion should only be expressed when the auditor concludes that the financial statements give a true and fair view (or are presented fairly, in all material respects) in accordance with the identified financial reporting framework.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><b><u>The Unqualified Audit Opinion</u></b></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>"In our opinion, the accompying financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as at year end date, and its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with relevant accounting standards".</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><b><u>Emphasis of Matter</u></b></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>To highlight a material matter regarding a going concern problem, if there is significant uncertainty (other than a going concern problem) which may affect the financial statements on its future resolution, for example:</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>"Without qualifying our opinion we draw attention to Note X to the financial statements. The Company is the defendant in a lawsuit alleging infringement of certain patent rights and claiming royalities and punitive damages. The Company has filed a counter action, and preliminary hearings and discovery proceedings on both actions are in progress. The ultimate outcome of the matter cannot presently be determined, and no provision for any liability that may result has been made in the financial statements."</p>

                    <p><b><u>Modified Audit Opinions</u></b></p>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Disagreement</b> - Except for & Adverse Opinion</li>.
                        <li><b>Limitation of Scope</b> - Except for & Disclaimer of Opinion.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <p><b><u>Disagreement - "Except for"</u></b></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>"As discussed in Note X to the financial statements, no depreciation has been provided in the financial statements which practice, in our opinion, is not in accordance with Internation Accounting Standards. The provision for the year ended 31 December 31 XXXX, should be XXX based on the stright-line method of depreciation using annual rates of 5% for the building and 20% for the equipment. accordingly, the fixed assets should be reduced by accumulated depreciation of XXX and the loss for the year and accumulated deficit should be increased by XXX and XXX, respectively."</p>

                    <p id="government-bonds1"><b><u>How does Government Debt Work?</u></b></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Government borrowing is different from the debts we run up as individuals. That's because countries can riase taxes and issue their own currency, giving them ways to pay back loans.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Borrowing allows governments to spend more on public services and projects than they raise in taxes. They ofen borrow to bridge the gap between income and spending because tax rises are politically difficult, leaving citizens with less money and threatening economic growth.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Countries borrow from each other or from global organisations like the World Bank or the International Monetary Fund (IMF).</p>
                    <br>
                    <p id="government-bonds2"><b><u>What are Government Bonds?</u></b></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Governments around the world issue bonds in order to borrow money to help pay their bills: Investors, including banks, insurers and pension funds as well as individuals, buy them in order to earn a return.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Rather than simply calling them 'UK Government Bonds', they are often referred to by nicknames or abbreviations.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Don't worry about why, it's enough to know that when people talk about gilts, that's our government's debt. US bonds are called treasuries, German ones are bunds, French ones are OATs, and Japanese ones are JGBs.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Governments issue bonds with a range of different maturities - 3 months, 1 year, 10 years, 30 years and more. This is the length of time governments are giving themselves to pay back investors.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Short-dated bonds are those that mature fast, in normal times are deemed less risky as a result. Long-dated bonds are those where investors have to wait a while to see their money again, and are regarded as riskier because there is more time for things to go wrong.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p id="government-bonds3"><b><u>How Government Bonds Work</u></b></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Governments also raise money by selling bonds, often to institutional investors or pension funds. An investor buying a bond is lending the government money for an agreed term, and many bonds pay out interest at regular interbals - known as coupon payments (interest).</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>When the agreed term of a bond ends - known as its maturity date - the government pays back the original sum of money. Some bonds are very short-term, others last for decades.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p id="government-bonds4"><b><u>What are Bond Prices and Yields?</u></b></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Bond prices are the cost of bonds, or what investors pay to buy the debt, and bond yields are a measure of the annual return  to investors who buy government debt. The yield is the interest rate, or coupon, that you earn for holding the bonds. Bond prices and yields move in opposite directions. When prices move up, yields fall, and vice versa.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p id="government-bonds5"><b><u>Bond Price Movement</u></b></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Which direction they are going in is basically down to the level of demand for bonds in the market at the time. When there is strong appetite for bonds, because people see them as a safe haven, for example, their prices rise and governments get away with paying less interest on their debt via lower-yields.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>When there is a bond sell-off, because people think they can get a better return from stocks, for example, their prices fall and governments end up paying higher interest to attract investors via a better yield.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p id="government-bonds6"><b><u>What can Bond Market Moves tell us about the Future?</u></b></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Financial experts watch government bond markets closely because they help explain investors' attitide to current events and risks. They might even foretell what will happen in the future - such as an economic boom or a recession.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Bond watchers do this using an important and revealing indicator called the yield curve, so it's worth learning how this works and decoding the confusing jargon surrounding it.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p id="government-bonds7"><b><u>What is the Yield Curve?</u></b></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>At it's simplest, this shows what yield you are getting for bonds with different maturities at a single point in time. Usually, the yield or interest rate will be lower on bonds with shorter maturities because it's not long until investors get their money back, so they see them as less risky and will accept a lower return. However, the yield tends to be higher on bonds with longer maturities like 10 years because there is more chance of things going wrong, so investors see them as more risky and want a better return.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p id="government-bonds8"><b><u>How to Invest in Government Bonds</u></b></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>When a government decides they want to raise funds through government bonds, it will issue them and typically sell them through a bond auction to banks or other financial institutions. These banks and financial institutions will then sell these bonds on, usually to funds or individual investors. Buying government bonds directly from the government typically involves purchasing them directly from HM Debt Management Office or from authorised agents. Of course, individual bonds can still be purchased through the LSE the same way you would purchase shares in a company.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Instea of buying individual bonds, you could also invest in them through funds. These are typically in the form of exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which invest in government bonds for you. Instead of being given a maturity date and being paid regular interest from the government, you will instead be given a regular income through dividends.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>This of government bond ETFs as index-linked gilts. Much like how an ETF for the FTSE 100 would track the value of the FTSE and pay dividends accordingly, a government bond ETF works much the same as it tracks the value of the gilts instead of you directly investing in them. There are no coupon payments when you invest in government bonds through an ETF, and your bond doesn't expire, through you may have to pay management fees to the fund managers. These ETFs can be purchased through trading accounts, similar to individual bonds or shares.</p>

                    <p id="government-bonds9"><b><u>Types of UK Government Bonds</u></b></p>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Standard UK Government bonds or gilts.</li>
                        <li>Conventional Gilts - with calls that allow the government to repay before the maturity date.</li>
                        <li>Index-Linked Gilts - coupon tracks RPI.</li>
                        <li>Undated or Prepetual Gilts.</li>

                    <br>
                    <p id="government-bonds10"><b><u>Why Invest in Government Bonds</u></b></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Even though they may seem similar to buying individual shares in a company, buying government bonds can be useful fixed-income securities that come with their own advantages.</p>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Since countries and their governments tend to be quite stable, government bonds are typically lower risk and could offer a stable, regular investment. After all, it would require the entire government to crash for you to lose your money.</li>
                        <li>That said, you should keep in mind that this can still happen. Take Greece's economic crash in late 2009, for example. Greece may have seemed like a stable country, but the government-debt crisis would have ruined the value of many government bonds. So, while unlikely, it's still possible.</li>
                        <li>Investing in government bonds could also be a great way to diversify your portfolio. Since they are linked to the government, if the market dips and the shares in your portfolio decrease in value, your investment in government bonds could remain stable.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p id="government-bonds11"><b><u>How is the Price of UK Bonds Calculated?</u></b></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>There are a few reasons why the bond price changes:</p>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Interest Rates.</li>
                        <li>Coupon Rates.</li>
                        <li>Maturity Times.</li>
                        <li>Credit Rating.</li>
                        <li>Inflation Rates.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <p id="government-bonds12"><b><u>Government Bonds vs Corporate Bonds</u></b></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Government bonds are quite different to corporate bonds. A corporate bond is when you are loaning money to a business instead of a government. This allows a company to raise funds for projects and may allow them to obtain more money than the banks will lend them. This is much like investing in shares of a company, though you can think of corporate bonds as interest-bearing shares.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>You can hold your corporate bonds and receive interest until the maturity date, or you can try to sell it for a profit on a secondary market, forgoing the interest payments for an immediate return.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>You should keep in mind that prices and interest rates could fluctuate as the performance of a company could be less stable than a government, and the company could even fail entitely. As a result, corporate bonds could offer a higher-risk investment that has the potential for higher growth when compared to government bonds.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p id="government-bonds13"><b><u>What are the Risks with Bonds?</u></b></p>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Interest Rate Risk:</b> <i>as interest rates predominantly influence the price of a bond, these pose the biggest risks to bond traders. Rising interest would cause the bond market to fall in value. It is recommended that traders assess both the duration of a bond and its interest rate projections when looking to purchase or trade bonds.</i></li>
                        <li><b>Inflation Risk:</b> <i>inflation reudces the purchasing power on a bond's face value and any coupon payment. When inflation rises, it can cause interest rates to rise, in turn reducing the value of the bond. However, traders can opt for an interest-linked bond that increases in value with the rate of inflation.</i></li>
                        <li><b>Liquidity Risk:</b> <i>liek any market, liquidity can affect your ability to buy and sell bonds effectively. However, government bonds are less likely to carry liquidity risks when compared to corporate bonds. However, if liquidity risks are present, the seller may struggle to sell their bond at its expected price. Sellers may be forced to accept a lower-than-expected price, causing the market's value to fall.</i></li>
                    </ul>

                    <p id="government-bonds14"><b><u>Bonds and Quantitative Easing</u></b></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Quantitative Easing (EQ) is when central banks go into the financial markets and create new money to buy financial assets. Those assets are bonds, mainly government bonds. However, they can also be corporate bonds.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p id="government-bonds15"><b><u>How much is the Bond Market worth?</u></b></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Calculating a specific figure is not straightforward and it does change as markets move. The McKinsey Global Institute published some figures in 2011 which put the outstanding amount of bonds at more than $100 trillion (£73 trillion). About 40% of it was government bonds. The whole bond market ar the time was, according to these figures, worth about double the value of global shares.</p>
