                    <p>Before we explore accounting in depth, it's important to understand that the type of business structure shapes almost every part of the accounting process - from how profits are calculated and taxed, to who has reporting obligations, and even how decisions are made.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>We're going to cover the most common forms of businesses in the UK, and those are;</p>

                    <p>Throughout this website, you'll notice that accounting topics - whether in management, financial, or taxation - are explained with reference to these business types.

                    <h1 id="sole-traders">Sole Traders</h1>
                    <br>
                    <p>In the UK, a sole trader is the simplest and most common business structure, where the business is owned by one person. From a legal view, the business and the individual owning it, are a single entity (they are one in the same). This means that there are; <u>Legal and Accounting</u>, <u>Personal Liability</u>, <u>Financial Reporting Standards</u>, and <u>Taxation</u>, that are implicatied for the business owner personally (again, they are one, not separate).</p>
                    <br>
                    <h2>Legal and Accounting</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>The taxable profits of a sole trader are taxed as personal income for the owner of the business, this is where they will pay Income Tax and National Insurance Contributions – similar to that of an employee. <span class="info-wrapper">
                        <span class="info-button" onclick="toggleInfo('info1')">i</span>
                    </span></p>
                    <div id="info1" class="info-box">Taxable profits are calculated by reviewing the business's incomes and expenses from Revenue down to Accounting Profit (as shown in the Income Statement), focusing only on those amounts that are taxable. It’s this taxable profit that Income Tax and National Insurance Contributions are based on. (Capital Allowances are subtracted from this in substitute for depreciation)</div>
                    <br>
                    <h2>Extent of Personal Liability</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>Due to sole traders and their owners being viewed as one by the law, not only is their income regarded as personal, as are their liabilities; meaning, all liabilities (creditors – suppliers, banks, customers), are the business owner’s responsibility. This opens them up to lawsuits regarding the seizure of personal assets (property, savings, vehicles etc) for repaying back money owed to creditors. <span class="info-wrapper">
                        <span class="info-button" onclick="toggleInfo('info2')">i</span>
                    </span></p>
                    <div id="info2" class="info-box">In other words, sole traders have no legal protection from debts and losses the business incurs, and should that happen, the business owners personal assets are “up for grabs”.</div>
                    <br>
                    <h2>Financial Reporting Standards</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>Sole Traders do not have any responsibilities as far as statutory reporting goes, at least as far as the law is concerned. However, they must document and report to HMRC a list of incomes and expenses generates within the financial year, along with file their taxes in their self-assessment. <span class="info-wrapper">
                        <span class="info-button" onclick="toggleInfo('info3')">i</span>
                    </span></p>
                    <div id="info3" class="info-box">Incomes and Expenses that are documented, must also be kept for a minimum of 5-years from the date of self-assessment deadline. (i.e., for 25/26 (6th April - 5th April), the self-assessment deadline would be 31st January 2027 - so they should be kept until 31st January 2032).</div>
                    <br>
                    <p>Despite their being no legal obligation besides incomes and expenses, it is best practice for Sole Traders to document their finances as any company would.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Doing so would better allow them to plan, budget for and prepare for the period/s ahead. It does not need to be as extensive as companies, but the better they are, the better prepared they will be.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h2>Taxation</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>As we know, sole traders are taxed as individuals, and are subject to Income Tax and National Insurance Contributions, however, another key aspect of taxation for sole traders, would be their pension contributions too. Before we get to the rates of Income Tax, NI Contributions and Pensions – let's first explain how a pension would work for a sole trader.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Pensions contributions are broken down into two main categories, Public and Private. A public pension would be tailored for those more situated within a civil servant role, for example, NHS, Government, Police, Ambulance Service, Fire Service etc. A sole trader would not find themselves to be within this category, however, this is still relevant in the case where the owner of a sole trader was previously within such roles. A private pension would be tailored for those more situated within a role that does not full under the purview of a civil servant, someone like a business owner.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>If the owner of a sole trader has a public pension, contributions to such pot would be prevented – in other words, the account would be frozen preventing contributions to it. However, it will still rise due to inflation, and it will still become available upon retirement age. With the move from a civil servant position to being a business owner, the owner would opt for a private pension, where they can contribute to that. Upon hitting retirement age, the business owner would begin to receive both public and private contributions that they made as income.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Because the sole trader’s income is taxed as personal income, the question arises to whether taxable income is reduced by the contributions, and how HMRC view it. To simplify things, at the end of the financial year, the pension provider will notify the contributor with a summary, detailing their gross pension contributions (the amount in which they contributed, and tax-relief secured), this, along with taxable profits of the sole trader will be submitted to HMRC on/by the 31st January through a Self-Assessment. This is due the following year to the financial year the self-assessment pertains to.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>As for contributions to the pension pot, there are limitation to the amount contributed, and implications in going over them. You can find this below, along with rates etc.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p>When a business decides to launch a product/service, there are costs that are incurred as part of the production process, or delivering a service. It is during this phase that Accountants need to absorbe fixed overheads, or in other words, the costs of the business as a whole that are nothing to do with the production or delivery of service. These are things like rent, gas and electricity, salaries for Accountants, lawyer fees etc.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>These costs need to be absored into each unit sold/service provided. This process helps businesses cover the costs of running the business for each and every unit sold/service provided. There are two main ways in which businesses do this;</p>

                    <p><u><b>Duties, Rights and Responsibilities of Auditors</b></u></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Companies Act legislation goes deep into the duties and responsibilities of auditors, where the auditor must express an opinion based on finalised financial statements of companies, and they cover the following:</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><u><b>Auditor's Report on Annual Accounts</b></u></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Auditors must prepare a report for the shareholders of the company, based on the annual accounts of that company. The auditor must also give their opinion as to whether the accounts give a fair and true view of the company's financial position and performance. Whether they have been prepared in accordance with Companies Act 2006, and whether they comply with the relevant financial reporting frameworks.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><u><b>Auditor's Report on Director's Report</b></u></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Auditors must express an opinion on whether the information given in the directors’ report is consistent with the financial statements. Ensuring that the directors’ report does not contradict the audited financial statements.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><u><b>Auditor’s Report on Strategic Report and Directors’ Report</b></u></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Auditors must state whether the strategic report and directors’ report are consistent with the financial statements. Ensuring both reports align with the audited financial data, providing shareholders with reliable information.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><u><b>Duties of Auditors</b></u></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The duties of an auditor are to examine accounting records to ensure proper account records have been kept. Ensure consistency within the account and account records. Report if they have not received all necessary information for the audit. Ensure proper returns are received from branches not visited. If any of these are not met, the auditor must state this in their report.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><u><b>Auditors’ Right to Information</b></u></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Auditors have the right to access all books, account, and information required for the audit. Directors and officers must provide the requested information and explanations promptly. This ensures the auditor can fully investigate the company’s financial affairs without obstruction.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><u><b>Auditor’s Rights to Attend Company Meetings</b></u></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Auditors have the right to attend any general meetings, receive all notices and communications related to these meetings, and have the ability to speak on matters related to the audit and the financial statements. This ensures auditors can clarify and defend their findings directly to shareholders.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><u><b>Statement in Case of Auditor’s Removal</b></u></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>If an auditor is removed before their term ends, they can submit a statement explaining the reasons. The company must send this statement to all shareholders and notify them of its availability. This ensures transparency and allows auditors to express concerns about potential management interference.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><u><b>Auditor’s Rights in Relation to Written Resolutions</b></u></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>If shareholders propose a written resolution that affects auditors (e.g., removal), auditors must receive a copy of the resolution and have the right to respond in writing. The company must circulate the auditor’s response to shareholders. This prevents unfair removal or decisions without giving auditors a change to explain their side.</p>

                    <h2>Independence of Auditors</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p><u><b>Auditor Independence</b></u></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Auditors must remain independent and unbiased in their examination of a companies financial statement, and the Companies Act 2006 legislation enforces that this remains the case.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><u><b>Appointment of Auditors of Private Companies</b></u></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Private companies must appoint an auditor for each financial year unless they are exempt (e.g., small companies under audit exemption thresholds). The appointment must occur within 29-days of the companies financial year-end (if not already done at a general meeting). If a company fails to appoint an auditor, the directors have the authority to do so. This ensures private companies cannot indefinitely avoid audits, maintaining transparency and accountability.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><u><b>Appointment of Auditors of Public Companies</b></u></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Public companies must appoint auditors at each annual general meeting (AGM) to serve until the next AGM. Appointment also requires a majority vote by shareholders. This reinforces auditor independence by ensuring they are appointed directly by shareholders rather than management.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><u><b>Term of Office for Auditors</b></u></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Auditors hold office from the end of the meeting, at which they are appointed, until the conclusion of the next AGM (for public companies) or until an auditor is reappointed or replaced. This establishes a clear and consistent term for auditors, preventing indefinite appointments that could compromise independence.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><u><b>Reappointment of Auditors</b></u></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Auditors are automatically reappointed for the next financial year, however, unless a resolution has been passed to appoint someone else or not to reappoint them, they have declined reappointment, or the company is exempt from requiring an audit. This simplifies the reappointment process while allowing shareholders to intervene if necessary.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><u><b>Prevention of Automatic Reappointment</b></u></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Automatic reappointment is prevented if the auditor was appointed by the directors rather than by a resolution at a general meeting, a member of the company has notified the company of an objection to reappointment, or the auditor’s term has expired due to specific disqualification reasons (e.g., independence concerns). This safeguards against potential conflicts of interest by ensuring reappointment cannot occur automatically under certain circumstances.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><u><b>Resolution to Remove Auditors</b></u></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Shareholders may pass an ordinary resolution at any time to remove the auditor, regardless of their term in office. The auditor must be given notice and the opportunity to make written representations that must be sent to shareholders. This ensures that auditors can only be removed transparently and fairly, protecting their independence by allowing them to explain the circumstances to shareholders.</p>

                    <h1>2. Issues Involved in Planning the Audit</h1>
                    <br>
                    <h2>The Audit Year</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p><u><b>Interim</b></u></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The interim typically occurs partway through the financial year, usually six months before the final audit. The auditor elected by the board of directors at the annual general meeting will review internal controls, perform analytical procedures, and test transactions from start of the year until the period they are at. The purpose of this is to identify risks early while reducing the pressure at year-end, and to improve the efficiency of the final audit.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><u><b>Stock-Take/Inventory Check</b></u></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>At the end of the financial year, a physical inventory count is done, however, sometimes this is done at interim points too. If an external audit is required, auditors may observe the stock-take to ensure that it’s carried out correctly and that the valuation method aligns with relevant accounting standards. Companies that use perpetual inventory systems may choose to still perform periodic checks to ensure accuracy.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><u><b>Final Audit</b></u></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The final audit takes place after the financial year ends and when the full financial statements are prepared. This process involves verifying transactions, assessing year-end adjustments – like accruals and prepayments, and confirming the asset valuations. The auditors duty is to prepare a report based on their opinion, typically in the form of an audit report, stating whether they believe the financial statements give a “true and fair view”.</p>

                    <h2>Auditing Staff</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p><u><b>Partner</b></u></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The most senior member of the audit team is the ‘Partner’, and is responsible for signing off the audit report. This ensures that the audit complies with UK auditing standards (ISA UK) and regulatory requirements. They also review key audit findings and communicate with the client’s board of directors or audit committee.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><u><b>Directors</b></u></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Firms that are large tend to have directors who handle complex audits, review key judgements, and act as a final reviewer for other auditors before they sign the work off to the partner. Unlike partners, directors may not have any ownership in the firm.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><u><b>Managers</b></u></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The next on the list is the ‘Managers, and is responsible for overseeing the audit process and ensures deadlines, and quality standards are met. They act as the main point of contact between the audit firm and the client’s senior management team. Additionally, they review work done by supervisors and trainees before it goes to the partner. They ensure to allocate tasks within the audit team to make sure resources are used effectively.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><u><b>Supervisors</b></u></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Audit supervisors act as a bridge between trainees and managers in the hierarchy of auditing staff. They typically assist in the planning of audits, reviewing work completed by trainee auditors, and resolve potential technical issues.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><u><b>Trainee (or equvialent terms)</b></u></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Trainees are entry-level auditors completing their professional qualification. They typically carry out basic audit procedures like checking financial records, testing controls, and documenting findings. They are usually trained/given guidance until they have passed their professional qualification by their supervisors.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><u><b>Others</b></u></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Other audit staff members include forensic accountants who investigate fraud and litigation support, or technical specialists who provide areas in, for example, IFRS, tax, or data analytics. And we have IT auditors, who are more focused on technology and cyber risks in financial reporting.</p>

                    <h2>Use of Organisational Charts for Knowledge of Business and it's staff</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>Organisation charts are visual representations of a company’s structure, showing hierarchical relationships, reporting lines, and key personnel. In auditing, these charts help auditors gain an understanding of the business and its staff, which is crucial for assessing risk, internal controls, and fraud detection.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><b>Understanding the Business Structure</b></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>By having charts, auditors are better able to:</p>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Identify Key Decision-Makers</b> - who holds authority in financial reporting and operations?</li>
                        <li><b>Recognise Reporting Lines</b> - how responsibilities flow within the organisation.</li>
                        <li><b>Assess Decentralisation vs. Centralisation</b> - is financial control spread out or centralised?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <p>for example, in a multinational company, an organisation chart can reveal whether financial oversight is managed centrally or delegated to regional offices.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><b>Assessing Internal Control Responsibilities</b></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Organisational charts help in evaluating the effectiveness of internal controls by:</p>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Identify Key Control Roles</b> - who is responsible for authorising transactions and approving financial statements?</li>
                        <li><b>Spotting Segregation of Duties Issues</b> - are conflicting roles assigned to the same person, or with someone of relation (family)?</li>
                        <li><b>Assessing Risk of Management Override</b> - if all financial control is concentrated in a few hands, the risk of fraud increases.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <p>for example, the Head of Finance also oversees internal audits, this could be a red flag for independence issues.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><b>Fraud Risk Assessment and Related Parties</b></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Organisational charts help auditors:</p>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Detect Conflicts of Interest</b> - are there undisclosed relationships between key personnel?</li>
                        <li><b>Identify Related Parties</b> - are key individuals in positions to influence transactions with related entities?</li>
                        <li><b>Assess Management's Influence</b> - if one person has excessive control, they could manipulate financial reporting.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <p>for example, if a company's CEO and procurement manager are related, the auditor may need to investigate potential self-dealing or procurement fraud.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><b>Planning the Audit and communication</b></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Auditor's use Organisational Charts to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Determine Who to Interview</b> - identify key personnel for inquiries on controls and financial reporting.</li>
                        <li><b>Plan Audit Procedures</b> - understand which departments handles key financial processes.</li>
                        <li><b>Coordinate with Internal Audit & Compliance</b> - ensure alignment with the company's internal risk management.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <p>for instance, if payroll errors are identified, the auditor can quickly pinpoint which department and personnel oversee payroll processing.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><b>In Conclusion</b></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Organisational charts are essential in audit planning and risk assessment. They provide insights into:</p>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The structure and key personnel of a business</li>
                        <li>The effectiveness of internal controls and segregation of duties.</li>
                        <li>The potential for fraud, conflicts of interest, and management override.</li>

                    <h2>Assessments</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p><u><b>Inherit Risk</b></u></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>This is the risk of a material misstatement ocurring in the financial statements due to the nature of the business or its transactions, before considering internal controls.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Factors affecting Inherit Risk:</p>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Quality of Internal Controls</b> - for example, high-tech companies with complex revenue recognition.</li>
                        <li><b>Complex Transactions</b> - for example, derivatives, mergers, or acquisitions.</li>
                        <li><b>High Level of Estimation and Judgement</b> - for example, asset valuations, provisions.</li>
                        <li><b>Rapid Business Growth or Significant Changes in Operations.</b></li>
                        <li><b>Past Fraud or History of Errors in Financial Statements.</b></li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <p>Auditors assess inherit risk at both the financial statements level (risk of fraud) and the accounts (risk of accounts like revenue or inventory).</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><u><b>Control Risk</b></u></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>This is the risk that a material misstatement will not be prevented, detected, or corrected by the client's internal controls.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Factors affecting Control Risk:</p>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Quality of Internal Controls</b> - for example, segragation of duties, IT controls.</li>
                        <li><b>Management's Attitude towards Internal Controls and Fraud Prevention.</b></li>
                        <li><b>Complexity of the Organisation's Financial Reporting Processes.</b></li>
                        <li><b>Weakness in Prior Internal or External Audits.</b></li>

                    <br>
                    <p><u><b>Detection Risk</b></u></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>This is the risk that auditor's procedures do not detect a material misstatement that exists in the financial statements.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Factors affecting Detection Risk:</p>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>It is influenced by the nature, timing, and extent of audit procedures.</li>
                        <li>It is inversely related to substantive testing - if inheret and control risks are high, auditors reduce detection risk by increasing the extent of testing.</li>
                        <li>It can arise due to human error, poor audit planning, sampling limitations, or the complexity of financial statements.</li>
                        <li>Auditors manage detection risk by improving audit procedures, using professional scepticism, and applying technology and data analytics where appropriate.</li>

                    <h2>Audit and Assurance Council's Definition of Materiality</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>The definition is: “Misstatements, including omissions, are considered to be material if they, individually or in aggregate, could reasonably to be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements.”.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The Key Aspect of Maturity are:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>User-Oriented:</b> where materiality is assessed based on the potential impact on the user of financial statements (investors, creditors, regulators).</li>
                        <li><b>Quantitative and Qualitative Factors:</b> where quantitative is often a percentage of benchmarks such as profit before tax, revenue, total assets, or equity. And where qualitative is even small misstatements where they can be material if they affect compliance with laws, debt covenants, or management integrity.</li>
                        <li><b>Context-Specific:</b> where materiality depends on the nature and circumstances of the business and financial statements.</li>
                        <li><b>Applied Throughout the Audiy:</b> where auditors determine materiality at the planning stage and reassess it as the audit progresses.</li>

                    <h2>General Controls and Application Controls</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>For auditing, there are IT systems built for auditing, and these are referred to as General and Application Controls. They help in ensuring the reliability and accuracy of financial reporting and compliance with regulations. They are as follows:</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><u><b>General Controls</b></u></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>These are broad, overarching controls that apply to the IT environment as a whole. They help ensure the reliability, security, and integrity of systems used in financial reporting. For example:</p>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Access Control</b> - restricting access to authorised users only.</li>
                        <li><b>Change Management Controls</b> - ensures proper authorisation and testing before the system changes or updates.</li>
                        <li><b>Backups and Recovery Procedures</b> - regular backups, disaster recover planning, and testing.</li>
                        <li><b>IT Security Policies</b> - establishing policies on data protection, cybersecurity, and IT governance.</li>
                        <li><b>Software Development Controls</b> - ensures new systems or updates are tested before implementation.</li>
                        <li><b>Physical Security Controls</b> - restricting access to data centres or servers.</li>

                    <br>
                    <p>These controls reduce the risl of unauthorised access, system failuresm or data corruption that could impact financial reporting.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><u><b>Application Controls</b></u></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>These are controls specific to individual software applications used in financial processing (accounting software, payroll systems, ERP systems). They help ensure accuracy, completeness, and validity of data within applications. For example:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Input Controls</b> - validations to prevent incorrect data entry (required fields, format checks).</li>
                        <li><b>Processing Controls</b> - ensuring correct processing of transactions (reconciliation, system calculations).</li>
                        <li><b>Output Controls</b> - ensuring reports and financial statements are accurate and complete.</li>
                        <li><b>Integrity Checks</b> - vertification of data accuracy across different systems (audit trails, cross-checking balances).</li>
                        <li><b>Authorisation Controls</b> - ensuring only authorised personnel can approve transactions (manager approvals for payment).</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <p>These controls focus on data accuracy and validity within a specific system rather then the IT environment as a whole.</p>
